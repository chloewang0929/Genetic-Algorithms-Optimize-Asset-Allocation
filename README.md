# Genetic Algorithms Optimize Asset Allocation
# Introduction

Asset Allocation and Portfolio have been very popular topics for many years. Investors can obtain excess returns and diversify their investments by investing in different financial products.

As we all know, when investing in financial products, high returns come with high risks. Nobel Prize Winner in Economics
Markowitz proposed the concept of investment portfolio in 1952, using the metaphor of "eggs should not be put in the same basket" to illustrate the importance of risk diversification; using diversification to reduce the risk of investing in commodities, it is expected to achieve the lowest risk effect. . Among them, expected return is often defined as the simple average of daily profits and losses in the past period; risk, also known as volatility, is often defined as the standard deviation of daily profits and losses in the past period. The larger the standard deviation, the greater the standard deviation of the asset in the past. The greater the fluctuation, the greater the risk.

By allocating assets with low correlations in a portfolio, you can effectively diversify volatility. During significant downside risks, unlike single assets, other positions in the portfolio may have bullish trends, thereby hedging the losses. This is equivalent to installing shock absorbers for your investment. A portfolio with relatively small losses will tend to have a stable profit and loss curve, which is beneficial for investors to use leverage.

Since the portfolio is a weighted result, its cumulative return will lie between the upper and lower bounds of the cumulative returns of the individual assets within the portfolio. However, with effective risk diversification, the volatility from leverage will be at a similar level to investing in a single asset without risk diversification, while still enjoying multiple times the excess returns.

Whether obtaining higher returns with the same risk or significantly reducing risk with the same returns, portfolio management is greatly favored by investors. However, creating an optimal portfolio poses a significant challenge for average investors with limited computational power and financial knowledgeâ€”they cannot guarantee the quality of their investment portfolios. Therefore, this research aims to solve this issue through the use of genetic algorithms.
